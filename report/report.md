* What design decisions did I make?
* Description of *methods*

## Evaluation

* Does the program actually work? How well?
* If it doesn't work, why not?
    * What partial successes do I have that deserve extra credit?

## Allocation of Effort
As this was an individual programming assignment, all work was done by myself.
